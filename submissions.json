["Goshdarnit, when they said \"When will per learn proper diary management and security, hahahahahahahahahah\", they..... were right, for frigg's sake. I do hate when I'm wrong ðŸ˜ .","Dear diary, it's currently 11:05 on a Saturday evening and I'm hunched over this journal in a public restroom waiting for...nothing? Earlier today my boss had fired me, my mom had kicked me out since \"I wasn't doing anything for the family.\" and now I'm sitting here with my packed suitcase in a restroom somewhere. Greeeeeaaaaaaat, just perfect. What the fuck will I do now. Can someone just hold me and tell me everything is okay, I wish I had someone to be there for me.

Which seems to be moving on without me making it so I can barely keep up with my work. I wish I could elaborate on my work more but I feel as if I'm not the only one who is reading these..."]
