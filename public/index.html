    <h3>a collaborative, open to the public writing project</h3>
    <p>
        users can submit their own diary entries, ideally in-character for the person the diary seems to describe. every 24 hours, a new entry
        will be chosen at random and added to the list. new entries can build off of the existing ones to ideally over time create a public
        profile of a hypothetical writer.
